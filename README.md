## Greetings!

Welcome to my GitHub page!  I am in the process of transisting careers to become a data scientist, and I recently became Microsoft Certified as a Azure Data Scientist Associate.  I am currently studying for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

I have included projects written in Python and R.  Two of my best projects are:

<https://github.com/drchachere/Word-Prediction-NLP-Shiny-App> - a word prediction web application written in R
<https://github.com/drchachere/Real-Estate-Sale-Type-Classification-Model> - a comparison of classification models in Python
