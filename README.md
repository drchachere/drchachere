## Greetings!

Welcome to my GitHub page!  I have included projects written in Python and R.  Two of my best data projects are:

<https://github.com/drchachere/NCAA-BB-Tourn-Qualification> - after scraping, aggregating and merging data, built and deployed a classification model as a Flask app

<https://github.com/drchachere/Word-Prediction-NLP-Shiny-App> - a word prediction web application written in R
